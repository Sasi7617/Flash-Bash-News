# Flash-Bash-News
This project is a dynamic news website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API integration. The site fetches real-time news data from an API, displaying headlines and articles from various sources. HTML was used to structure the content, CSS for styling and responsiveness, and JavaScript to handle API calls, implement search functionality, and add interactivity. The project demonstrates the effective combination of web development skills to create an engaging and user-friendly platform.
